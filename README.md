### Shiny Firebase Data/Session Saving and Sharing

this repo is an example how to share shiny application data in a quick and intuitive way. Once the user clicks on "create link", the defined variables are send to firebase and a link is generated.
As those steps require to trigger a function on button click, and then a change of the link text, shinyJS is used extensivly.

 - Refactoring functions to get them more efficient/compact.
